    "## Exercise 0: Gain a basic understanding of BERT and its derivatives\n",
    "Generally, our problem can be phrased as a text classification task, where deep learning models based on the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. 2017) achieve state-of-the-art results (e.g., Yang et al. 2019). Transformers use self-attention to attribute varying relevance to different parts of the text. Based on transformers the BERT model was developed (Devlin et al. 2019), which includes crucial pre-training steps to familiarise the model with relevant vocabulary and semantics. In addition, the DeBERTa model (He et al. 2021a) adds additional pre-training steps and disentangles how positional and text information is stored in the model to improve performance. For this experiment we rely on the most recent version of the model, which is DeBERTaV3 (He et al. 2021b).\n",
    "We use the default version of DeBERTaV3_small as described in He et al. 2021b with an adopted head for text classification. For this, we add a dropout layer with user-specified dropout rate and a pooling layer that passes the embedding of the special initial token ([CLS], comprising the meaning of the whole Tweet) to the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain a deeper insight into \"self-attention\", BERT and DeBERTa, I provide you with a presentation discussing the project, which goes into great detail to explain these concepts. The slide can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hW4_wLj0QIEhFQdKqVj6Uep2fWMqrbeek_5IjOUXeCQ/edit?usp=sharing) but I will also give the presentation at the beginning of the session.

    "We will use the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) for training our DeBERTa model. The library contains a plethora of [pre-trained models](https://huggingface.co/models) that can easily be [accessed](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/autoclass_tutorial) (including tokenization), modified for your task (used for classification, next sentence predicition, etc.) and [fine-tuned](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training) for your use case. \n",

We are importing modules from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), which is a popular library that we use for splitting our dataset and analyze our results. In addition, we use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), which is low leve (compared to Hugging Face) library that can be used to build deep learning models from scratch. Here, we just use it to test if the notebook has access to gpus and to compute some metrics."

    "## Exercise 7: Analyze results \n",
    "\n",
    "To improve our models and gain a deeper understanding on their characteristics, we would like to look at additional metrics other than the f1 score. And find ways to visualize our results to get a more detailed view on our predictions than a single number (f1-score) can provide.\n",
    "   \n",
    "For this, we would like to plot a confusion matrix, a ROC curve and an inidicator to evaluate the confidence of the model. To visualize any results, we will first need to make predictions with our model on the test set, which is done in the next cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Confusion matrix:**\n",
    "Now, we can plot a confusion matrix, which can easily be done by using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html) and their provided function   \n",
    "`sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, *, labels=None, sample_weight=None, normalize=None)`\n",
    "* `y_true`: true label values\n",
    "* `y_pred`: predicted label values\n",
    "* `labels`: names of our labels (\"not raining\", \"raining\")\n",
    "* `normalize`: allows normalization of matrix by default number of labels is shown. we use `normalize='all'` such that total fractions add up to 1.\n",
    "The function `sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay` provides a way to plot the resulting confusion matrix. This is all implemented in function `plotting.analysis.check_prediction`, which you can use for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AUC and ROC:**     \n",
    "After obtaining your sigmoid probabilities at the end of your classification task. You are left with two values, one for either label. However, usually you assume the threshold to be at 0.5, however you can always shift the threshold of what's considered labeled as \"raining\" and \"not raining\" to change for example your True Positive Rate or your False Positive Rate. Therefore to have a more 'objective' measure of the performance of your classifier, ROC and AUC come in handy as they consider all thresholds. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of a ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) and the derived AUC value (Area Under the ROC Curve), take a look at [google's explanation](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc). \n",

    "In the following tasks, we will compare our predictions to the ground truth values, which corresponds to our 'raining' field in `ds_tweets`, i.e. `ds_tweets.raining.values`. This field is two-dimensional. However, our predictions are now two dimensional as the sigmoid function converts our predictions into probabilities for either class (\"raining\", \"not raining\"). Thus, we obtain our \"1D\" prediction by using `numpy.argmax`, which returns the index of the maximum value along the axis. We apply this function over the last axis to obtain our 'predictions', i.e. `prediction=preds.argmax(-1)`.\n",
