    "JSC has very strict security restrictions to avoid misuse of the compute resources. JSC does not allow logging into the systems solely with a password, but requires key-based authentication via SSH connections from whitelisted IPs.As a first step, you will create a SSH key pair for public/private key authentification. Then, you will register the public keys for access to JUWELS using the JuDoor web page. To do so, it is required to add a meaningful restriction of the range of IPs or hostnames that are allowed to connect to JUWELS. Finally, you will be able to connect to Juwels. This exercise guides you through the process that is explained in more detail in the Juwels access documentation pages.Execute the following command in the command line to create an ED25519 key pair directly into your .ssh directory.\n",

    "The public key (ending in .pub) is similar to your hand-written signature: you may give it to others who can then use it to confirm your identity. The private key (maelstrom-bootcamp) must not be shared. Continuing with the hand-written signature analogy, the private key is the way you write your signature. Just as you would not give others the ability to perfectly copy your hand-written signature, you should under no circumstance publicize your private key.Before you can add your public SSH key to the list of authorized SSH keys for JUWELS, you must create a valid from-clause that meaningfully restricts the range of IPs for which an SSH connection with the given key will be permitted (whitelisted). You have several options to that, e.g. check the IP range of your internet service provider (ISP). If you know the IP of your ISP, or if you can connect to a VPN giving you a fixed IP range (FZ Jülich's VPN is an example, but other institutions work as well), this is very easy. You can directly use the IP range as a from-clause. For FZ Jülich your from-clause would be:"
